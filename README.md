# Translation-Cleaner-Project
# Text analysis and cleanup tool for translators and editors
# The idea for Translation Cleaner has come through personal experience and suffering :) Having translated for years without professional #translating tools, I have wasted too much time on final cleanup of the text and calculating the final price manually. Even Spellchecker #takes too much time for my taste.

# The goal of the program is to clean up several translation texts at once (like double spaces, space before a punctuation mark, accidental word repetition). Also, I wanted to be able to exclude custom characters from price calculation, so that, say, number characters wouldn't be charged for. And to finish off, I wanted to see the files as a list in a separate document with all the details such as number of characters/total pages translated along with the price for each document shown. Translation Cleaner is meant to be lightweight, quick and easy to use and free. It's meant to make life easier for translators and text editors.

# I completed and published the first version which was far from being user-friendly and had limited functionality in the end of May 2019 as my final project for Programming II online course in University of Tartu. Having received positive feedback, it was clear that the program could be of interest and use to more people. So now the goal is to translate the existing version into English, add functionality and make it user friendly, add a proper GUI and rewrite the code so that it's simpler to read and understand.

# I have uploaded the initial version of the program in Estonian just so I could see later where I started from and compare it to the end result. I'm intending to have fun with it!

# Please feel free to try it out (when it reaches some level of usability :) ) and throw me a line of comment. I am what you would call a beginner in programming but feel free to suggest any improvements and with help of stack overflow and google I might decipher and be able to put your ideas into life. Cheers!
