# Translation-Cleaner-Project
# Text analysis and cleanup tool for translators and editors
# The idea for Translation Cleaner has come through personal experience and suffering :) Having translated for years without professional translating tools, I have wasted too much time on final cleanup of the text and calculating the final price manually.

# The goal of the program is to clean up several translation texts at once (like double spaces, space before a punctuation mark, accidental word repetition). Also, I wanted to be able to exclude custom characters from price calculation, so that, say, number characters wouldn't be charged for. And to finish off, I wanted to see the files as a list in a separate document with all the details such as number of characters/total pages translated along with the price for each document shown. Translation Cleaner is meant to be lightweight, quick and easy to use and free. It's meant to make life easier for translators and text editors.

# I completed and published the first version which was far from being user-friendly and had limited functionality in the end of May 2019 as my final project for Programming II online course in University of Tartu. Having received positive feedback, it was clear that the program could be of interest and use to more people.
